Ringfall Tactics: A Keyway Companion (A Keyway Campaign)
When all has fallen, we must rise.

With the acceleration of Ringfall impacts and the proliferation of Ring-based technologies, the homeworld of the Highest has fallen to infighting. Former empires struggle to hold onto even the core of their territory, foundries are sabotaged, and kaiju walk the world - destroying anything they come across.

Crushed between those larger forces are small non-aligned partisan groups, often with only a handful of weapons at their disposal. Some are still trying to get offworld, others still think the kaiju can be beaten back to orbit. Most are just trying to survive any way they can.

This is a story about a group of mech pilots who find an unexpected treasure, get looped into a story much greater than themselves, and in the end, make an indelible mark upon the universe.

Features:
-Turn-Based Mech-on-Mech and Mech-on-Kaiju Action!
    “An unexpected mix of Mechwarrior and Kingdom Death without the negatives of either!”, ~IGN.
-Deep narrative campaign with interpersonal interactions between pilots.
    “I reloaded fifteen times to try to save Aerith, and this game hurts more.” ~Evan from Gamestop
Build up an arsenal and try to save the world!
    “So the Gigas-class has more base HP, but the scaling…” ~Logan
Engage with your friends in either co-op or competitive modes!
    “I really don’t like board games but this was on a screen so it was less bad!” -Casey

In Depth Feature Analysis:

Isometric tactical RPG
    -Mechs and Kaiju should feel very different, and interact with completely different systems.
    -Mechs utilize an equipment based system to track HP and attacks.
    -Damaging subsystems renders them unusable. Taking a shot to the engine is different from taking one to your main gun.
    -Kaiju utilize a card-based system to track both their HP and attacks.
    -Dealing damage to them removes that many cards from their topdeck, eliminating possible attacks.
    -Capture the feel of using subsystems to enhance your mech. Use “Scan” to find out what weapons are being charged. Attack them for massive damage! Activate boosters to take to the sky. Self-destruct to save your allies in a last-ditch effort to save them. Maybe even consider an ejection seat to save your pilot!
    -Hunt for upgrades, securing them from post-battle rubble, opposing mech squads, or recover Ringfall Cores, the critical component in creating a new mech.
    -Initiative order: DnD style, or team-turns a-la Into the Breach? (Outstanding Q)
    Fog of War (Outstanding Q)

Campaign
    -Two phase campaign - swapping between Downtime and Mission.
    -During downtime, you will modify your mechs’ equipment, heal from grievous wounds, make decisions about your group’s future, and have your pilots fall in love.
    -During missions, you will fight against opposing groups, kaiju, and fulfill mission objectives for loot, money, or just to survive.
